# Tennis-Video-Detection

## AIM

The aim of the project is to implement a video detection model which is capable of identification of players involved in the match, tennis ball and the keypoints of the tennis court. Once detected, we will also generate a mini map of the court which will showcase player and ball movements. At the end we also calculate player and ball related statistics such as player speed, ball speed etc.
